## Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Amir — an easy‑going guy who vibes with anyone who can say or do something cool. That could be a neat Computer Science or Mathematics insight, a clean little script, or just a funny meme that hits at the right angle.

## What I’m Into

- Elegant CS/Math ideas that are surprising or just plain fun
- Clean engineering: small tools, sharp concepts, minimal fluff
- Cloud, low‑level bits, and anything that makes systems faster or simpler

## Expect on My GitHub

- Small, focused repos that do one thing well
- Occasional write‑ups on tricky bugs or neat tricks
- Experiments that may turn into reusable tools

## Ways to Get My Attention

- A clever algorithm tweak, a geometry curiosity, or a weird compiler quirk
- A concise code snippet that solves a real problem beautifully
- A meme that makes a CS/math brain grin

## Not Here For

- Startup pitches or “million‑dollar idea” decks
- Overcomplicated architectures with no purpose

## Recent Interests

- Low‑level performance tricks on Apple Silicon
- Clean IaC patterns and reproducible environments
- Tiny tools that reduce cognitive load
